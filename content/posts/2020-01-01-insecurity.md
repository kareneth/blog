While I don't feel [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) as much anymore, I do find it hard to speak up. Sometimes it's a matter of finding an opening to interject, while other times it's because I'm still formulating my thoughts. Regardless, each lost moment can add to my insecurity. I like how this quote turns another thing I can feel guilty about into something encouraging.

Mike Monteiro in [Ruined by Design](https://www.ruinedby.design) also helped me realize the importance of my own voice and perspective.

What are you afraid of? That they'll tell you you're wrong? Hosanna in the highest and St. Joan of Arc be praised. That's exactly what you should be hoping for! Be thankful for the employee that will tell you that while you have a chance to do something about it." -Mike Monteiro
