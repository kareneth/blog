  While The Mind didn't win the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 (Azul deservingly won),
  I actually play this more often with family due to its cross-cultural,
  family-friendly, non-snobbiness aspects. I also think it'd be great for team
  building at work.

The Mind is a simple card game that's surprisingly addictive considering it only takes 5 minutes to explain. Gameplay lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour. You can read the [full rules here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind), but it's essentially the card version of the ice breaker where you order yourselves in a line from youngest to oldest. But with cards numbered 1 to 100 (you get *n* cards in level *n*, and *n+1* cards in *level n+1*). And remember, no talking. 

![the mind card game](/media/2020-01-01_mind.jpg "Dan and I successfully advancing to Level 6 with cards 4, 10, 14, 45, 47, 54, 62, 69, 70, 71.")

There's several ways this co-operative game helps you learn to work together. 

Since you can't talk, you learn to watch for the slightest body movement. The eyes are a given, but then you start noticing somebody hedging a bit. You can't ignore it, after all, it might be lower than yours, so then you establish eye contact and feed off each others energy. You learn to weigh your own decision against that of the team. Together, sink or swim. I see this naturally building empathy among teammates at work. Did you notice your coworker begin to speak but then stop because they were interrupted? There's so much you can see in body language if only you'd stop talking.    

The next level adds another card. So in the example above, Dan and I each had 5 cards in Level 5, but when we moved to Level 6 we each had 6 cards for a total of 12 dealt out entirely. 

While we both shuffled the cards, we inevitably started talking, strategizing, and sometimes apologizing. "*Why didn't you go faster?!*" slowly changed to "*Sorry, I should've waited.*"  Blaming each other doesn't really work because, like in real life, what do you really win if you're right? Right or wrong, if you fail as a team, you still lose a life point. What you do learn is tiny agreements and a new start each level. 

When we played in a larger group, I couldn't help but be reminded of an agile retrospective meeting. After all, the point is to get the team to reflect on the past iteration, and what they should stop, start, or continue doing. And this continues every iteration. It takes a few levels, but eventually the team gets to a good rhythm.

An added benefit that I was not expecting was being able to play cross-culturally. The language frankly did not exist and everybody can count to 100. Since there's no talking, Dan was able to play with both my parents and my sister-in-law's family. While they couldn't really converse in between rounds, they all agreed afterwards that it wasn't really necessary to achieve this **默契，mo4qi4**. In Chinese, this tacit understanding comes after you've connected at a very deep level with each other. You can see individually how these words lead to that.

![默契mo4qi4, tacit understanding](/media/2020-01-01_mo4qi4.png "默契 (mo4qi4) means a well coordinated group that has achieved mutual understanding. That makes sense since 默 (mo4) means tacit and 契 (qi4) means agreement.")

All in all, for $15, I love how this simple game was able to be played across any language and age. It highlights how even a random group of people, young or old, American or Chinese, can form a team. And best of all, the immense satisfaction you get when you start thinking and playing like a team.
