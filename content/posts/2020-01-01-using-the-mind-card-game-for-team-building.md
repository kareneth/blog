  While The Mind didn't win the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 (yeah, Azul was
  better), I still really like playing in with family and friends. I can see
  myself playing this as a team building game at work.

The Mind is a simple card game that is surprisingly addictive considering it only takes 5 minutes to explain. Gameplay lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour. You can read the [full rules here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind), but it's essentially the card version of the ice breaker where you order yourselves in a line from youngest to oldest. And remember, no talking.

There's several ways this co-operative game helps you learn to work together. Since you can't talk, you learn to watch for the slightest body movement. The eyes are a given, but then you start noticing your teammates hesitatingly reach out with their own card. Is it lower or higher than yours? You can't ignore it, because if you go instead of them (and shouldn't have), the entire team loses a life. You learn to weigh your own decision against that of the team. Together, you sink or swim.    

Each level adds another card. So you would have 3 cards in level 3, 4 in level 4, and so forth. While somebody shuffles and prepares for the next round, inevitably you start talking, strategizing, and sometimes apologizing. "Sorry, I should've waited." "You should go faster next time!" Blaming each other doesn't really work, after all, it is pretty much luck-based. But while everybody talks, it can't help but remind me of an agile retrospective meeting. After all, the point is to get the team to reflect on the past iteration, and what they should stop, start, or continue doing. It takes a few levels, but eventually the team gets to a good rhythm.

An added benefit that I was not expecting was being able to play this across any language barriers. Since there's no talking, Dan was able to play with my parents. While they couldn't really converse in between rounds, they all agreed afterwards that it wasn't really necessary to achieve this mutual understanding (默契，mo4qi4). In Chinese, this means you've connected at a very deep level with each other.
