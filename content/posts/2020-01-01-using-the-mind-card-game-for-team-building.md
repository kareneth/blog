  While The Mind didn't win the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 (yeah, Azul was
  better), I still really like playing in with family and friends. And I think
  this would work out in the workplace as a team building game.

The Mind is a simple card game that is surprisingly addictive considering it only takes 5 minutes to explain. Gameplay lasts anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour. You can read the [full rules here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind), but it's essentially the card version of the ice breaker game where you order yourselves from youngest to oldest.
