Screamfree Parenting is Hal Runkel's approach to parenting. He says that "parenting is not about kids, it's about parents. If you're not in control, then you cannot be in charge. What every kid really needs are parents who are able to keep their cool no matter what."

I found myself agreeing with a lot of it. 

It made me reflect on how I was raised, and how a lot of how that - for better or for worse - has shaped me into who I am today. And how that in turn, didn't have to reflect how I raise my Little Duck. One particularly poignant chapter asked me to describe my ideal relationship with her when she was 25. Wow, what a jump. And from that, to work backwards into how I raise them today. Ah, well that makes sense. A lot of it even applies to how I want to lead my work team today.

Here's a list of my favorite quotes:

\--- up to p116 (chapter 6 really)

**Chapter 7 - the importance of language**

On p114

> *"Labels are among the most powerful forces that shape our relationship with the world. Labels have the remarkable ability to stick far beyond their reasonable life span... Take a moment now to glance at just a few of the labels parents commonly use. Which ones have you been carrying around all these years?"* 

and on p115

> *"The tricky part about labeling is that often these labels seem accurate. After all, they don't simply arrive out of thin air. Labels are typically based on some observable trait or behavioral pattern.*
>
> *But hear this: You are not a prophet. Most likely you are also not a biogeneticist. You cannot predict how your children will turn out based on your own intuition or on your family's physical, mental, and emotional characteristics."*

and on p116

> *"We are so quick to judge our children according to small slices of life, without ever seeing a broader picture of the different possibilities."* 

and on p116

> *"I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief."* 
>
> *\-Gerry Spence* 

and on p116

> *"Whenever we label our children, we severely limit their space...By labeling, we stamp out the wonder inherent in the childhood journey."*

and on p118

> *"People love to categorize, compare, and contrast. For some reason, it helps parents and their extended families feel as if they know their children. And we love to know our children. After all, what kind of parents would we be if we didn't?* 
>
> *So, as they venture out into the world, say for a sleepover, we arm the unsuspecting family with a list.*
>
> > *"They're finicky, you know." we warn.*
> 
> *This list may include sleeping habits, the order of bedtime rituals, and an extensive list of their favorite foods. When they come home saying all went well and they even ate green beans for dinner, we find ourselves putting them back into place. "But you don't like green beans!" As if their palates are already determined; as if we are the gatekeepers to any new preferences.*
