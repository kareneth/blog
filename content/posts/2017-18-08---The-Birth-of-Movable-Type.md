All of my agile teams have team or working agreements in place. I find them useful for setting expectations and holding the teams accountable. But as Bernd astutely observes, it's not a set it and walk away deal. Because as the team shifts, so should the team agreement.   

I like to set a quarterly reminder to review the working agreements, but if anybody leaves/joins the team, then we also review it. If we try something different from a retrospective and like it, that also gets added. 

These constant reminders make it a seamless part of our workflow, and less of a surprise every time we pull it up to review.
