> “In my opinion, though, the greatest value that a PM brings to your software development project is the assurance that you have a single point of contact, aware of every aspect of your project, who will oversee the work, communicate with you, and keep work moving forward smoothly. Your PM is the project gatekeeper whose only goal is to make the project (and you) successful.” - Mary Lotz
