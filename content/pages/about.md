Hiya! I’m Karen or 施智怡. I enjoy organizing, eating fresh baked bread, playing board games, watching chinese/taiwanese dramas, pretty handwriting, stationery, and traveling. I try to learn something new every day. I’ll dabble in most anything, and have several half-finished projects to prove it. If you stumbled here from karensbetterthan.danielgempesaw.com, then you’ll know I’m also married to Dan.
