title: About me
---
Hiya! I’m Karen or 施智怡. I enjoy organizing, playing board games like riichi mahjong, watching chinese/taiwanese dramas, well-spaced handwriting, pretty stationery, traveling, eating fresh baked bread and literally surrounding myself with warm laundry. I try to learn something new every day. I’ll dabble in most anything, and have several half-started projects to prove it. If you stumbled here from karensbetterthan.danielgempesaw.com, then you’ll know I’m also married to Dan.
