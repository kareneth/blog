Hiya! I’m Karen or 施智怡 (shi1 zhi4yi2).

I enjoy buying anything that'll keep me organized, traveling to anyplace with a market, playing board games like riichi mahjong, watching chinese/taiwanese dramas, pretty handwriting on pretty stationery, eating fresh baked bread and literally surrounding myself with warm laundry. I try to learn something new every day. I’ll dabble in most anything, and have several half-started projects to prove it. 

If you stumbled here from [karensbetterthan.danielgempesaw.com](https://karensbetterthan.danielgempesaw.com/), then you’ll know I’m also married to my best friend, Dan.



PS I'll also talk about my journey in learning Chinese and include word breakdowns from my [Pleco app](https://www.pleco.com/). Here's the meaning of my name, Zhiyi.
